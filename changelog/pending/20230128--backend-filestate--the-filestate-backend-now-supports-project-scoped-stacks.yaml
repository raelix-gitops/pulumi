- type: feat
  scope: backend/filestate
  description: |
    The filestate backend now supports project scoped stacks. You will
    need to migrate your state store to enable project support by running `pulumi state migrate`. Old CLI
    versions will not understand new stacks, but may write stack files to the old pre-project locations, new
    CLIs will warn if they see those files and suggest running `pulumi state migrate` again.
